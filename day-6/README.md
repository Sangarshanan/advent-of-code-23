# Wait For It

As part of signing up, you get a sheet of paper (your puzzle input) that lists the time allowed for each race and also the best distance ever recorded in that race. To guarantee you win the grand prize, you need to make sure you go farther in each race than the current record holder.

The organizer brings you over to the area where the boat races are held. The boats are much smaller than you expected - they're actually toy boats, each with a big button on top. Holding down the button charges the boat, and releasing the button allows the boat to move. Boats move faster if their button was held longer, but time spent holding the button counts against the total race time. You can only hold the button at the start of the race, and boats don't move until the button is released.

```
Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
```

This document describes three races:

- The first race lasts 7 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 9 millimeters.
- The second race lasts 15 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 40 millimeters.
- The third race lasts 30 milliseconds. The record distance in this race is 200 millimeters.

Your toy boat has a starting speed of zero millimeters per millisecond. For each whole millisecond you spend at the beginning of the race holding down the button, the boat's speed increases by one millimeter per millisecond.

### Part Two

As the race is about to start, you realize the piece of paper with race times and record distances you got earlier actually just has very bad kerning. There's really only one race - ignore the spaces between the numbers on each line.

So, the example from before:

```
Time:      7  15   30
Distance:  9  40  200
```
...now instead means this:

```
Time:      71530
Distance:  940200
```

Now, you have to figure out how many ways there are to win this single race. In this example, the race lasts for 71530 milliseconds and the record distance you need to beat is 940200 millimeters. You could hold the button anywhere from 14 to 71516 milliseconds and beat the record, a total of 71503 ways!

How many ways can you beat the record in this one much longer race?
